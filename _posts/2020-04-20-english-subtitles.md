Released in 1981 on Glass Records. YES... not a reissue, but an original stock copy (including insert) recently discovered by band members.

Both sides are pretty great and fairly polished sound, a doomy slice of malevolent goth-rock, full of foreboding and self-loathing; Karl Burns from The Fall plays drums on the track, but not many other details survive...
