Punk rock didn't come to Topeka, Kansas until 1979, but when it did it hit like an atom bomb. Abuse took their cue from The Stooges and the New York Dolls and then blended that into a sound all their own.  

Clay Galbraith's sneering vocals and slinky bass lines, Willie McNeil's pile-driver drums, and Chris Garner's chainsaw guitar created a perfect storm of American rock and roll. Three of these tracks were originally released on Flexi-disc in Bill Rich's legendary fanzine 'Talk Talk' in 1981, and a fourth unreleased track, 'All I Wanna Do', is included here for the first time ever. This is raw primal rock, the way it was meant to be played!!!
