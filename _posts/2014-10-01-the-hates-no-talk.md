The Hates has been called "Houston's first and last punk band", and with over thirty years of blood, sweat, and that familiar mohawk, those words may be more true than their author ever knew.

From his very first live show in 1978, Christian Arnheiter has steered this legendary band through decades of disco, pop, new wave, hair bands, hip-hop, crossover country, and now the newest fad of tribute bands to keep punk rock alive. In a time when many early eighties groups are getting back together to play reunion shows, the Hates have the distinction of being the oldest continuously performing unsigned punk band. And despite the love/hate relationship the local music scene has had with punk rock over the years, the Bayou City will always be their home. This anthology is the definitive selection of their early years, ALL STUDIO MATERIAL recorded between 1979-82. TEXAS PUNK LIVING LEGENDS!
