The Colors formed in 1978 when native New Yorkers Tommy Cookman (vocals) and Paul Sass (guitar) began playing together, they were joined in early 1979 by Australian bassist Robert Vickers.

After a playing only a few shows they signed a management deal with CBGB became the house band there. The classic power pop EP, "Rave It Up" was released in 1980. Many great shows followed, opening for The Undertones, Eddie and the Hot Rods, The Bay City Rollers, The Plasmatics, etc. The Colors built a loyal and enthusiastic fanbase in New York and ventured out to tour the East Coast, Chicago and New Jersey. In 1983 the band released "The Colors" Lp on Dirt Records too late to save the band from breaking up. Paul Sass had left and Robert Vickers soon left to join Australian band The Go-Betweens in London. The Colors had a brief existence, less that four years in total, but their star shone brightly during that time; illuminating the murky grim of the old Bowery and the dimly lit side streets of a low rent, crime ridden Manhattan that disappeared so completely in the boom of the late 80s. This anthology is a snapshot of that time, of boundless youthful optimism in a bankrupt city on the edge of America. A true masterpiece... be fast to grab this piece of HISTORY!
