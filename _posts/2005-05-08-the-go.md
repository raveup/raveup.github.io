The Go were an amazing power pop band out of Yonkers, New York. Their rare four-tracks EP was produced by Rob Freeman (who had engineered the debut LPs of the Ramones, Blondie - Robert Gordon).

This essential collection contains all studio material (recorded between 1980 - 82) + cool photos and bios. If you like Ramones and Jam... this record will be a must!
