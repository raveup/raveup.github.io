Hailing from Fresno, CA, NBJ have been one of the best kept secrets of American punk rock.

Known for their shocking name and the anarchist anthem "Dead Porker" (included in 1982 within the Alternative Tentacles cult-compilation "Not So Quiet On The Western Front"), they featured the late great Annelle Zingarelli as one of the wildest female vocalists of Californian hardcore. Their music, influenced by peers such as Germs and Flipper, was a blend of savage rock'n'roll and darker Black Sabbath-like doom marches. They shared the stage with kindred spirits like Black Flag, Minor Threat and Circle Jerks and were a Jello Biafra favorite. This Lp puts together the best tracks from their unreleased 1983 demo, including a furious cover of Monkees’ classic "Last Train To Clarksville" and all the energy of this talented and unlucky band.
