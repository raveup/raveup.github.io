It was 1979 and, rising from the ashes of Italian punk groups like Hitlers, Mr. Plastic Girls were back to shout out to the world that Punk wasn't dead (at least not in Pordenone) coming back with their brand new band called Waalt Diisneey Production! 

Approximately 30 years after "Live in Disneylands' issue on Reverendo Moon returns the remastered version on Big Star Rolling: a record that every punk lover cannot miss including 3 bonus studio tracks to complete this re-issue plus an unpublished live track. 
Limited edition including a photobooklet with fantastic photos never published before. 
So, no excuses, it's a perfect Christmas gift!
Hurry up we're about to finish them!
