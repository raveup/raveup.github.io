A terrific collector's nightmare! Killer Texas punk from the vault!

This album contains all their late seventies recordings (the legendary "Take One" E.P and tracks which appeared on "Are We Too Late For The Trend..." compilation) + outtakes and live tracks. Full color PS and liner notes written by Artie Turner.
