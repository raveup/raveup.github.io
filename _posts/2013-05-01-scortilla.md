Scortilla were formed in 1979, influenced by DEVO, punk and early wave bands. They only 'hit' was Fahrenheit 451, released on major label in 1984.

Architects of live acts with a great sound and visual impact, they have played around Italy at the hideouts of the underground music, establishing their headquarters at the Psycho Club of Genoa (the cradle of true art rock scene of that period). Intransigent about their artistic choices, they closed their career after one only vinyl release. This anthology collects the recordings of the first period of the band - absolutely amazing material. Tracks like "Military rendez- vous", "Chanson de non amour", "Dresden", "Climax", "ADA", "Mirror Dance", "Inside" and also their hit "Fahrenheit 451", published by the WEA in the summer of 1984, are all featured on this vinyl. For those that consider Gaznevada and italian new wave at the same level of other euro stuff, this is a record to consume up to pulverize! Absolute masterpiece!
