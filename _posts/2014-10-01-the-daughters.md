Inspired by the British Invasion, 60’s garage bands, power pop, and their love of the New York Dolls, the Daughters formed in early 1980 on the North Shore of Boston, MA.

As with many bands, it wasn’t long before they found themselves in need of a new member when drummer Bobby Morin (later of the Real Kids) left the band. So in May 1980, Dave Ives, Bill Doherty, and Joe Mazzari recruited Simon Ritt to fill the drum seat. Bill and Dave had been playing together since high school, as had Joe and Simon, and the band dedicated themselves to their music. When the band won studio time in a battle of the bands competition, they took advantage of this time to record some original songs. These studio recordings ended up on self released cassettes that received airplay on Boston area radio stations. In January 1981, Dave who often sang lead and wrote many of the songs left the band to pursue other interests. Joe, Bill, and Simon continued on as a three piece, and at the end of the month played CBGB’s for the first time. The band continued to be busy throughout the year, but managed to find time to recorded an EP, which was released on an independent Boston label in September 1981. The EP had three songs, one written by each member of the group. Then in January 1982, Bill left the band. So Simon moved up front to play bass, and Keith Chagnon came on to play drums. Through their manager, the band recorded an album at Euphoria Studios in Boston, which was produced by Jimmy Miller (producer of the Rolling Stones, Traffic, and Motorhead, to name but a few). The album was never released. The band split-up defitenely in 1984. So, NOW, after long time, you can finally listen their amazing rock'n'roll in this definitive anthology that contains the best of their career! The Daughters are still alive!
