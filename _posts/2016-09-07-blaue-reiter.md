Blaue Reiter was a seminal post punk band from Alessandria, not so far from Turin. They appeared in autumn 1982 on the compilation "Gathered" edited by "Rockerilla", who at the time was the leading magazine for anyone interested in the new rock trends.

The song of the band - where Marco Goggi focused on vocals and drums, Flavio Gemma on bass and Paul Boveri on guitar - was "A Correct Adulation Of Himself" and was extracted from a demo, laconically entitled "Five Songs "tune in style and mood with some minimal post-punk, incisive in rhythmic and wrapped in gloomy atmosphere quite appreciated in the initial glimpse of the 80's. In April of 1983, the trio recorded four other pieces, called "Demo Tape"(!). Definitely... essential.
Gemma and Boveri, together with Enrico Ferraris (already with Dusty Zebra, ensemble pre Blaue Reiter) and Roberto Molded, would shortly founded the Viridanse, that were quite popular in the underground scene of the mid Eighties. Essential for every fans of Young Marble Giants, Fra Lippo Lippi, Eyeless in Gaza, Durutti Column!
