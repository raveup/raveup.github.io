Skopje, North Macedonia: hometown not only of Mother Teresa, but also of Fol Jazik - the first Macedonian punk rock band ever! 

Formed in 1978 by singer Vlado Hristov aka KRLE, they played a psych-garage influenced punk and were renowned for their bizarre look and powerful shows. In 1979 they disbanded and shorty after reformed with a new line up, before definitively calling it quits in 1980. Despite their short career, theyâ€™re still considered one of the most influential Yugoslavian bands, as proved by this brilliant 1979 single.
