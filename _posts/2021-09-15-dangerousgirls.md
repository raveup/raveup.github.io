1978, Birmingham UK: Mike Cooper (vocals), Rob Peters (drums), Chris Ames (guitar), Rob Rampton (bass) form a band called Dangerous Girls. 

First gig booked with Dexy’s Midnight Runners (then known as the Dynatones), UB40 and Surprises (50p entrance), but pulled at the last minute. First actual gig in Dudley (with Dexy’s Midnight Runners, The Surprises all playing their debut gig). The band builds a following but, with no records out, Chris leaves in April 1979 & Beetmoll joins on guitar 2 days before his first gig.

July 1979: first single out, “Dangerous Girls/I Don’t Want To Eat (With The Family)”. Play UK tours offering use of the PA, lights and equipment to local bands who wish to play.

November 1979: live “Taaga” Ep released, reaches number I in the last indie chart of the 70’s. John Peel describes the band as “spasm rock”. Sign to London indie label Human Records. 3rd record “Man In The Glass/M07S”, then 4th record “Step Out/Sidekick Phenomena/Men In Suits”. BBC Radio I session "Dangerous Girls/Simmer/Instict/Domestic Blisters". Start to record an album, “Nerve Ends”, but Human Records go bust & album abandoned.

1982: the band splits. Get together again in 2012 for reunion gigs with new members Micky Harris (bass) and Jake Simmons (guitar). Chris Ames rejoins and the band self-release first vinyl album “Highbury Studio May 2015”.
