Boston was a hotbed of punk starting in the mid-70s but in those days it was tough for bands to put out records.

They left 1/4-inch reels of tape at the local radio stations and got played on the air. Sometimes vinyl would follow, usually not. This two-LP set, based on these ultra-rare tapes, is an incredible and unique documentation of the Boston punk scene in the late 70s-early 80s, with 30 killer tracks from 22 of the top bands (including Unnatural Axe, the Thrills, La Peste, the Dogmatics, Baby's Arm and Lou Miami & the Kozmetix), all unreleased or hard to find. A must for fans, collectors and anyone who was there.
