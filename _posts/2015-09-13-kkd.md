Italian 1982 electronic synth new wave legendary band, studio tracks and red blood vinyl.

They were compiled on mythical 'First Relation' sampler Lp, the holy grail of the Italian wave and post-punk scene (featuring Aus Decline, V.U.D,Dark Tales, Militia, F.A.R, Lisfrank, Take for Run and Tanzen's Field).
This album contains all their studio tracks, missing for long time and now discovered! The anthology contains their classic tracks, "And Your Mind", "House TV" and other minimal synth jewels.

> Don't miss this album, first 200 copies are in red blood color!
