Howlin' from Bloomington, Indiana, The Gynecologists were probably one of the most outrageous and repellent punk bands ever.

Inspired by the everlasting violence of American society, their songs evoke a chilling maelstrom of depravation and amorality, while their obsession with sex and feces makes GG Allin look like a priest. The material on this anthology has never been released before on vinyl: while confirming a challenging musical creativity and the powerful vocals of frontman Tommy Afterbirth, it reveals unexpected links with American classic rock (take a listen to their cover of Grand Funk Railroadâ€™s "We're An American Band").
