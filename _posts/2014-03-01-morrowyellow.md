Founded in 1983 in Verona by Mauro Marchesi (keyboards and electronics) and Joyello Triolo (vocals and guitar), after the split of the punk band Eva Brown.

Morrowyellow blended electronic sounds with the fascination for art and oriental music. These experimentations led to collaborations with avant-garde theater and contemporary dance. In 1985, with the entry of Turkish Max (bass and guitar), they began to perform live. The band recorded a great demo ("My Colours") and a few other songs, all included in this anthology. The group disbanded in late 1988, but their great music in still alive on this wax!
