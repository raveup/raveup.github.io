Late Sixties tracks from the greatest musical scene behind the Iron Curtain.

Many of you already know bands like the Matadors or the Plastic People of the Universe, but the Beat Czechoslovakia was an incredibly rich entity, full of great and unknown bands that met with ease the “Western” standards. Now, twenty years after the first volume, here is another bunch of frantic, weird and mind-blowing late Sixties tracks from the greatest musical scene behind the Iron Curtain! Surfaced from the deepest obscurity hear the Beatings, the Soulmen, the Framus Five, the Blue Effect and many more!
