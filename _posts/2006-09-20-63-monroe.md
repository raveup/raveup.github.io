Glam Punk idols from Canada! This album is the definitive anthology of their great tracks recorded between 1980-84.

All studio material taken from their mega rare first 12&quot; (released under the name of NFG), &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Out the Join&quot; Lp, rare demos and unreleased tracks. The band appeared also in various compilations such &quot;Killed by Death #10&quot; and others... Be Glam, Be Punk! Enjoy 63 Monroe!
