Canadian underground legends, all original studio recordings, finally out of Rave Up Records!

> “It wasn't so much that The Scenics were ahead of their time in 1977, it's more that almost everybody else didn't even know what time it was. The Scenics were on top of it though... New York had Talking Heads, and England was blessed with XTC, but here was their equal in Toronto and they never got the necessary push and support. It's fabulous we finally have the evidence, but it's a drag we haven't been able to enjoy it the past 30 years.” Bob Mersereau, CBC, author of "the Top 100 Canadian Albums" “DO THE WAIT” from IN THE SUMMER featured on UNCUT MAGAZINE MAY 2010 CD.
"Brainy crackpot art-pop with an ear for off-kilter melody, a headful of magic and twitchy grooves to burn. It's a sin the Scenics have left such a faint mark on punk-rock history... but the reborn cult starts here.”

> “The world's premier Velvet Underground interpreters are back with a new sizzling platter of original studio songs recorded in 1977/78... their poppy art rock & trippy jazzbo excursions will leave you sonically sated & wondering why most of today's bands are incapable of sounding half as good! Jeffrey Morgan authorized biographer of Alice Cooper/The Stooges
“They filtered Lou Reed, & contemporaries Talking Heads, Richard Hell, & Television, adding Big Star’s picking power-pop funneled into early XTC’s vigor, via clipped guitars, busy, sharp-edged bass, rhythmic drums, & idiosyncratic, loopy vocals—& made it all sound uniquely theirs, which is crucial.”

> “Largely unappreciated when they originally existed between 1976-81, these underground icons merged Television’s guitar work, Big Star’s pop prowess, Pere Ubu’s dementia, & the Ramones’ urgency.”
